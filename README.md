# bashinate

System (single machine focused) provisioning tool using [BASH scripting](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/) to install required system packages.

__NOTE:__ This is in no way ready for real usage and is being written for two reasons:

- I really should know more about BASH scripting.  Implementing this is going to teach me more.
- Other provisioning systems feel a little-bit heavyweight for my usual needs.  I'm sure they have good reason to be, but I really just want a light-weight provisioning helper that still works well with Vagrant.
